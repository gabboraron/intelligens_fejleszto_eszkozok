Modeling the World (in Julia)
==================

A series of [IJulia notebooks](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) containing mathematical 
models of different objects (both from the real world and from abstract constructions). Check them out, live:

* [Lorenz Attractor](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/pjpmarques/Julia-Modeling-the-World/blob/master/Lorenz%20Attractor.ipynb)
* [Mandelbrot Set](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/pjpmarques/Julia-Modeling-the-World/blob/master/Mandelbrot.ipynb)
* [Terminal Velocity](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/pjpmarques/Julia-Modeling-the-World/blob/master/Terminal%20Velocity.ipynb)
* [Archimedes and Pi](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/pjpmarques/Julia-Modeling-the-World/blob/master/Archimedes%20and%20Pi.ipynb)
* [Three-Body Problem](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/pjpmarques/Julia-Modeling-the-World/blob/master/Three-Body%20Problem.ipynb)
